# Pix Bot (ex-SAM)

Pix Bot is this smart person who thinks of turning off the light when leaving the office and turning on the coffee machine when arriving in the morning.

Pix Bot is this eco-responsible application that preserves resources (yours üí∞ and those of the planet üåç) while ensuring comfortable activity for the team.

Pix Bot helps developers and teams who host their applications on [Scalingo](https://scalingo.com) to manage them pragmatically and economically.

Services provided by Pix Bot:
- shut down Review Apps, at the time you want, every day of the week

- deploy a specific release into production via secured API
- deploy a specific release into production via a Slack command or shortcut
